  "So I dropped out of business school, and came home to run Tony's Place."
  "My own business. A few years earlier than I expected, but it feels good to be home."

  sky "Hey cutie, welcome to Tony's place!"
  "It's as if I left yesterday; everything just exactly the same as it was."
  "The same drunks, slumped into the same seats"
  "The bartender is the only person I don't recognize, which isn't suprising."
  "She is the latest in a long line of bombshell-beautiful, scantily clad sluts who have poured drinks at Tony's over the years."
  "On the books, Tony has never employed a bartender. The girls are reimbursed quid-pro-quo, in free food, a free apartment on the second floor, and all the free booze they can drink."
  "The only money they pocket are whatever cash tips they manage to coerce from the tightwad drunks who frequent the place."
  "As a result, the bartender's at Tony's place tend to be young, drunk, and eager to please -- a recipe, Tony would say, for happy customers."
  "Most of them only last a few months. Just long enough to meet their next abusive boyfriend or entangle themselves in something they'll later do jail time for."
  "I nod to the girl behind the bar, willing my eyes not to drop to her cleavage.."
  "...not to notice her full lips, her silky charcoal hair -- her flesh-tight halter-top. "
  "She nods back, considering me in a lazy but hungry way, like a lioness considers a prey animal who is just out of reach, for now."
  "She is, no doubt, a runaway from broken a home..."
  "A heartless temptress who devours souls..."
  "A shameless slut who on preys on people to get what she wants.."
  "I tell myself that I'm her boss now, that I can't allow myself to get distracted by another one of Tony's harlots"
  "God help me, I'm in love with her already."
  "In her bottomless eyes I see ..."

  "Kaytlin. My first kiss. She cornered me in the store room the day Uncle Tony told her I had a crush on her."
  "I was just a girl, but she was a woman."
  "A woman who was in love with being admired."
  "She overpowered me. Pinning me against the freezer door.. wordlessly holding me there, as if to say: {i} I can do whatever I want to you {/i}."
  "I didn't resist. I was happy to give her anything she wanted."
  "I think all she wanted was to kindle my crush into full-blown adoration"
  "She smelled like whiskey and watermellon bubblegum. Those infinite coffee-cream eyes of hers boring into my soul."
  "We locked lips like a thermonuclear explosion, and when I thought she'd pull away, she didn't."
  "My first kiss, like a 100-meter dash that became a sprint-marathon when the competitors refused to stop."
  "Never since, have I been kissed like Kaytlin kissed me. To this day part of me lingers still against the store-room wall."
  "Still locked in that kiss"
  "The overriding sensation, beyond than that of her delicate warmpth, was that of falling."
  "I fell and fell."
  "A virgin heaved from the clouds into the mouth of a volcano."
  "The heat ever rising until there was nothing but white-hottess and her lips."
  "Three days later, she threw a trashbag full of her belongings into the trunk of a buick and peeled off to hollywood with her new boyfriend."
  "No goodbye -- not even a backward glance for the girl whose life she'd changed forever."

  "Her tattoos remind me of Chloe, who gave me my first oral sex"
  "She called me \"milk-toast\", and treated me like a slightly-annoying little sister. Everyone knew she was a lesbian but Uncle Tony."
  "One Christmas eve, when neither of us had anywhere to go, we sat together in the closed bar, chatting happily in the flickering glow of Tony's ancient holiday decorations."
  "It was so intimate, that in the moment, we whispered to each other, even though the bar was closed and there was no one to hear us."
  "I remember how her tattoos took on a magical texture in the tangerine marmalade light cast by the cheap novelty christmas lights."
  "We played truth or dare, and when I chose truth, she asked me if I was a virgin."
  "Of course I lied and said no."
  "She laughed at my bullshit and challenged me to a game of darts, where the loser had to suck-off the winner."
  "That's how she said it. Not {i}go down on{/i} but {i}suck off{/i}. I thought she was so cool"
  "We both knew that Chloe made her side-money hustling darts, so her challenge amounted to a tacit invitation to felate her."
  "In my minds eye, I foresaw my own lurid defeat. How she would lean back against the table, and victoriously fold her arms across her chest, raising her eyebrow expectantly."
  "She would probably say something obscene and sharp, like {i}well? Get to work milk-toast{/i}"
  "Something like that.. only cooler"
  "Chloe was so tough, and she could really cut you with her words."
  "I would fall to my knees in defeat, and eagerly give her what she wanted."
  "But on that particular day, she was drunk and I was lucky."
  "Maybe she lost on purpose, because it was Christmas.  I'll never know for sure."
  "I remember the look she gave me when I hit that bullseye. A look of begrudging respect."
  "A look that only true hustler's reserve for each other."
  "I remember how I viciously bit down on my tongue as the mighty Chloe stuck her head up my skirt and went to work with her tongue."
  "A trick Uncle Tony taught me, to preserve the semblance of cool when, as he put it, the shit hit the fan."
  "I remember how empowered I felt with the toughest bartender Tony had ever hired between my legs, sucking me off. How supreme my control..."
  "How I nearly bit through my tongue to draw it out, resisting the exctacy as long as I could. Making her work to get me off." 
  "I remember her beautiful cleavage, the way her lips wholly consumed the delicate flower of my sex. How the tattoos on her shoulders moved as she worked, like they were alive in the dim-amber christmas light.."
  "Chloe was in prison by New-Years day. Busted in a Card-Sharping sting in Antlantic City."
  "I wish she had stayed home and played darts with me."

  "The sparsly populated bar explodes in a cacophany of excitement as the patrons who are sober enough to stand, hobble over to happily welcome me home."
  "The moment is endearing in the extreme, a group of shaky old drunks surround me, reaching out to touch me, as if they are not sure whether I've really returned, or whether I'm a group-hallucination."
  "One by one, they greet and embrace me. Clapping me on the shoulders or outright hugging me like I'm a grand-daughter they haven't seen in years, which, in a way I am."
