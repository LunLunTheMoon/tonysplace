event ideas: 
  suck off skyler in exchange for weekly cleaning : drastic willpower v skyler penalty and perm-benji
  skyler makes you do her laundry


event-rules

  Events are stuck to entities. Every time you interact directly with an entity, you have a chance to trigger events in that entity's queue.
  - locations are entities. So changing locations triggers events
  - characters are entities, so interacting with any character triggers events 



storyline ideas: 
skyler spies on ben from the gloryhole (forced bj's, enhanced humil, possible skyler/scott threesome)

we start low on cash flow and in debt. 

skyler starts training ben early. Calling him benji, asking favors, smacking his ass, borrowing money, etc.. each of these lowers ben's willpower, until he can no longer easily say no. 

skyler calls ben 'boss' when she respects him, 'bossman' or 'ben' when she's meh, and 'benji' when she's in power.
